# inventory-update  
This mod fixes minecraft's inventory problem, by forcing you to use one item at a time.  
ItemStack amounts are configureable for both normal and mini stacks.  
Although, we don't see why you would raise this above 1.  

**Modpacks/Servers, make sure the config is the same for both the server and client.**  
*This should be fixed in a future update.*  

**Requires:**  
- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) 1.19.4  
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net)
- [Stacc](https://github.com/Devan-Kerman/Stacc) (Bundled)  
- [SimpleConfig](https://github.com/magistermaks/fabric-simplelibs/tree/master/simple-config) (Bundled)
