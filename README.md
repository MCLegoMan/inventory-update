# inventory-update  
This mod fixes minecraft's inventory problem, by forcing you to use one item at a time.  
ItemStack amounts are configureable for both normal and mini stacks.  
Although, we don't see why you would raise this above 1.  

## Servers  
The mod is required on both the client and server.  
Whilst not required, it is reccommended to have the same config values on both the client and server.
