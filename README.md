# inventory-update  
This mod fixes minecraft's inventory problem, by forcing you to use one item at a time.  
ItemStack amounts are configurable for both normal and mini stacks.  
Although, we don't see why you would raise this above 1.  

## Servers  
The mod is required on both the client and server.  
Whilst not required, it is recommended to have the same config values on both the client and server.  

## Requires  
- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) 1.19.4  
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net)
- [Stacc](https://github.com/Devan-Kerman/Stacc) (Bundled)
