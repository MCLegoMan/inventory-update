# inventory-update
This mod fixes minecraft's inventory problem, by forcing you to use one item at a time.  
Max Item Stack Size is configurable, although we don't see why you would raise this above 1.  

## Servers
The mod is required on both the client and server.  
Whilst not required, it is recommended to have the same config values on both the client and server.  

## Requires
- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) b1.7.3  
- [Babric](https://babric.github.io/)  
- [SimpleConfig](https://github.com/MCLegoMan/fabric-simplelibs) (Bundled)
