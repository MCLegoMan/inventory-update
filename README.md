# inventory-update  
This mod fixes minecraft's inventory problem, by forcing you to use one item at a time.  
ItemStack amounts are configureable for both normal and mini stacks.  
Although, we don't see why you would raise this above 1.  

**Requires:**  
- Minecraft 1.19.4  
- [Stacc](https://github.com/Devan-Kerman/Stacc) (Bundled)  
- [SimpleConfig](https://github.com/magistermaks/fabric-simplelibs/tree/master/simple-config) (Bundled)
